### This directory is used to provide stuff for Docker builds.

# IMPORTANT
You do not need to build Docker images yourself, they are provided on the [Docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/defaltsimon/)

---
These files should replace standard ones. This makes sure that stuff like logs, etc. are put into /data and not elsewhere.

# HOW-TO
